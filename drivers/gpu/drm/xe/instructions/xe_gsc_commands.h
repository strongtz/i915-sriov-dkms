/*
 * All GSCCS-specific commands have fixed length, so we can include it in the
 * defines. Note that the generic GSC command header structure includes an
 * optional data field in bits 9-21, but there are no commands that actually use
 * it; some of the commands are instead defined as having an extended length
 * field spanning bits 0-15, even if the extra bits are not required because the
 * longest GSCCS command is only 8 dwords. To handle this, the defines below use
 * a single field for both data and len. If we ever get a commands that does
 * actually have data and this approach doesn't work for it we can re-work it
 * at that point.
