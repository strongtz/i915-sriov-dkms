/**
 * struct guc_log_buffer_state - GuC log buffer state
 *
 * Below state structure is used for coordination of retrieval of GuC firmware
 * logs. Separate state is maintained for each log buffer type.
 * read_ptr points to the location where Xe read last in log buffer and
 * is read only for GuC firmware. write_ptr is incremented by GuC with number
 * of bytes written for each log entry and is read only for Xe.
 * When any type of log buffer becomes half full, GuC sends a flush interrupt.
 * GuC firmware expects that while it is writing to 2nd half of the buffer,
 * first half would get consumed by Host and then get a flush completed
 * acknowledgment from Host, so that it does not end up doing any overwrite
 * causing loss of logs. So when buffer gets half filled & Xe has requested
 * for interrupt, GuC will set flush_to_file field, set the sampled_write_ptr
 * to the value of write_ptr and raise the interrupt.
 * On receiving the interrupt Xe should read the buffer, clear flush_to_file
 * field and also update read_ptr with the value of sample_write_ptr, before
 * sending an acknowledgment to GuC. marker & version fields are for internal
 * usage of GuC and opaque to Xe. buffer_full_cnt field is incremented every
 * time GuC detects the log buffer overflow.
