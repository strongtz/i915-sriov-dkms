/**
 * DOC: GPU page-table tree walking.
 * The utilities in this file are similar to the CPU page-table walk
 * utilities in mm/pagewalk.c. The main difference is that we distinguish
 * the various levels of a page-table tree with an unsigned integer rather
 * than by name. 0 is the lowest level, and page-tables with level 0 can
 * not be directories pointing to lower levels, whereas all other levels
 * can. The user of the utilities determines the highest level.
 *
 * Nomenclature:
 * Each struct xe_ptw, regardless of level is referred to as a page table, and
 * multiple page tables typically form a page table tree with page tables at
 * intermediate levels being page directories pointing at page tables at lower
 * levels. A shared page table for a given address range is a page-table which
 * is neither fully within nor fully outside the address range and that can
 * thus be shared by two or more address ranges.
 *
 * Please keep this code generic so that it can used as a drm-wide page-
 * table walker should other drivers find use for it.

 * @walk: Walk info.
 *
 * This function is similar to xe_pt_walk_range() but it skips page tables
 * that are private to the range. Since the root (or @parent) page table is
 * typically also a shared page table this function is different in that it
 * calls the pt_entry callback and the post_descend callback also for the
 * root. The root can be detected in the callbacks by checking whether
 * parent == *child.
 * Walking only the shared page tables is common for unbind-type operations
 * where the page-table entries for an address range are cleared or detached
 * from the main page-table tree.
 *
 * Return: 0 on success, negative error code on error: If a callback
 * returns an error, the walk will be terminated and the error returned by
 * this function.
