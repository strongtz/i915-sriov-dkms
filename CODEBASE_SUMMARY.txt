This repo packages an i915/xe kernel driver tree with SR-IOV support as a DKMS
module. It includes both the classic i915 driver and the newer xe driver, plus
build and distro packaging helpers.

High-level layout
- drivers/gpu/drm/i915: i915 driver with SR-IOV extensions.
- drivers/gpu/drm/xe: xe driver (newer Intel GPU driver) with SR-IOV support.
- include/: driver headers and uapi bits.
- compat/, dkms.conf, PKGBUILD, debian/: DKMS and packaging glue.

SR-IOV in i915
- Core SR-IOV logic lives under drivers/gpu/drm/i915/gt/iov/ and the
  i915_sriov*.c helpers. This handles PF/VF provisioning, GGTT updates,
  relay/messaging, and migration state save/restore.
- GVT (mediated vGPU) plumbing is also present under drivers/gpu/drm/i915/gvt/.
  This includes a dma-buf export path for vGPU framebuffer planes in
  drivers/gpu/drm/i915/gvt/dmabuf.c.

SR-IOV in xe
- SR-IOV support is spread across xe_sriov*.c, xe_gt_sriov_*.c, and
  xe_tile_sriov_*.c files (PF/VF control, provisioning, migration, and debugfs).
- The xe driver has its own dma-buf support (drivers/gpu/drm/xe/xe_dma_buf.c)
  and BO/VM helpers that handle imported/exported dma-bufs in general.

Looking Glass / KVMFR zero-copy note
- There are no references to KVMFR or Looking Glass in this tree.
- Any zero-copy behavior for Looking Glass is not implemented as a dedicated
  driver feature here; it relies on generic dma-buf support and the KVMFR
  module/userspace stack rather than SR-IOV-specific code in this repo.

Key files touched for dma-buf and vGPU
- i915: drivers/gpu/drm/i915/gem/i915_gem_dmabuf.c
- i915 GVT: drivers/gpu/drm/i915/gvt/dmabuf.c
- xe: drivers/gpu/drm/xe/xe_dma_buf.c
